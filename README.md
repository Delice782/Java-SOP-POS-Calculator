## Project Overview

This Java program simulates a console-based version of the SOP (Sum-of-Products) and POS (Product-of-Sums) Calculator. It allows users to fill a truth table with boolean values, then computes and displays the SOP and POS expansions based on the provided truth table.

### Key Design Considerations:

- **User Interaction**: Users input the degree of the function and boolean function values for each row of the truth table.
- **Validation**: The program validates user inputs, ensuring correct values are provided for the function.
- **Editing**: Users can edit function values in the truth table, ensuring accuracy.
- **Error Handling**: Invalid inputs are handled gracefully, with informative error messages guiding the user.
- **Expansion Computation**: SOP and POS expansions are computed and displayed based on the truth table values.

## Classes

### SOP_POS.java

This class contains the main logic for the SOP and POS calculator, including methods for reading user inputs, generating truth tables, allowing user edits, and computing SOP and POS expansions.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
2. Run the main method in the `SOP_POS` class to start the program.
3. Follow the prompts to interact with the SOP and POS calculator.
4. Test all functionalities to ensure proper operation.
